# steamcommunity-inventory
A rate limit and response handler for steamcommunity inventories.

# V1.0.0
It's functional, tests do pass, but there's only jsdoc as documentation and it could have bugs in it.
Will appreciate all feedback I can get.

# Plans
Current [TODO](https://github.com/danocmx/node-steamcommunity-inventory/projects/1) list.
Includes what I want to add in near future and also includes issues so you can suggest stuff.
